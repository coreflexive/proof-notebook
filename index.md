Welcome to my handwritten proof collection. Every proof is:
- Written with care
- Structured for clarity
- Scanned from my original pages

_This is what it looks like when you think before you hack._  
> A proof assistant might validate the result—but only if you’ve already understood it yourself.

This project is part of my journey through formal logic, type theory, and mathematical writing. I believe in clear thinking, beautiful structure, and human-readable formalism.
